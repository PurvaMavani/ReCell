# 🚀 ReCell - Supervised Learning Framework (SLF)

## 📌 Project Overview
ReCell is a **Supervised Learning Framework (SLF)** project focused on predicting the prices of used mobile devices. With the rise of the refurbished device market, ReCell leverages machine learning techniques to develop a dynamic pricing model. The project identifies key factors influencing resale value, such as device specifications, age, and market trends, enabling businesses to optimize pricing strategies and enhance customer acquisition.

## 🔍 Features
- **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical insights into the dataset.
- **🤖 Model Training**: Implementation of multiple supervised learning algorithms.
- **📈 Performance Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
